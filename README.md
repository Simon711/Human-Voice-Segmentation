# Human-Voice-Segmentation

### This is an algorithm to identify human voice and do segmentation automatically. 
The result will be compared to the manual segmentation data, then a accuracy report 
will be generated based on match rate, insertion rate and omission rate.

#### 1. Download the repository in zip or clone it to your local machine.
#### 2. Add the project into your Matlab directory path.
#### 3. Add you own voice into the folder, and segmentation reference point.
#### 4. Run `script3.m` then you will get report in the same directory, you might wanna modify the threshold, time tolerance and window size base on your need.
